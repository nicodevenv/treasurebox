Please locate the commands that starts with "treasurebox".

You'll see 2 commands available which are :

**Game configurator**

Run :
bin/console treasurebox:configurator

Follow the instructions and then finish using "F". It will generate the configuration file at "public/inputs/game_configuration.txt"

**Play Treasurebox**

Run :
bin/console treasurebox:play [OPTION: yes / no]

The option is used to display each step of the game when adventurer make a move [A], not when adventurer turns.
